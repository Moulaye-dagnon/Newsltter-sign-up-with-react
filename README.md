## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
I learned a better way to create a form and master screen resizing with react.js. In addition, I have improved my use of props and its power  
}
```



### Continued development

I will continue to practice to improve my knowledge and discover new syntaxes, new methods and increase my level of mastery in react.js
